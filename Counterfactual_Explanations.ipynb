    "## Introduction to Counterfactual Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "Counterfactual explanations provide insights into machine learning models by answering 'what-if' questions. They explain a model's decision by showing how the input features could be changed to achieve a different outcome. This concept is crucial in understanding and interpreting complex models, especially in high-stakes areas like finance, healthcare, and legal systems.\n"

    "At its core, a counterfactual explanation involves finding an alternative input that would lead to a significantly different prediction. Mathematically, if a model $ f $ predicts an outcome $ y $ for an input $ x $, a counterfactual $ x' $ is an input such that $ f(x') = y' $, where $ y' $ is a desired outcome different from $ y $. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be formalized as an optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the distance between $ x $ and $ x' $ subject to the constraint that $ f(x') = y' $. The distance can be measured in various ways, such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or more complex domain-specific metrics.\n"
